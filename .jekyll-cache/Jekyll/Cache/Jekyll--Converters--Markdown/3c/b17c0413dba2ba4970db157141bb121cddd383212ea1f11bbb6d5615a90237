<p>Text Only loads only text. All of that other stuff is great but it makes the internet slooooow. Now imagine youâ€™re in an area without adequate internet coverage or in the middle of a natural disaster without access to the internet at all; every kb counts. Text Only showcases websites that can still offer a good experience while being data accessible.</p>

<p>Text Only is powered by Jekyll. It takes a bunch of markdown &amp; .yml data and spits out beautiful, unadorned HTML. Quick &amp; easy. If youâ€™re interested in that kind of nerd stuff, <a href="https://github.com/joshosbrn/textonly">check out the source here</a>.</p>
