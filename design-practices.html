        <!-- {% for working in site.data.design-practices-latest %} -->
        <li>Areas of inquiry: experiment with possible topics/areas of inquiry that could serve as the basis for your collection (and ultimately your final archive). As you learned in our micro-collections exercise, start by developing several small collections (with different topic focuses, or just different levels of specificity)â€”see how they unfold. You will need to share your initial ideas and experimentation either in presented or written format on Wednesday. NOTE: Proper attribution is required for all collection items. If you can't attribute it, you can't use it.</li>
        <li>Proposals: identify 4 potential directions for your project, assemble into a proposal. include initial interests, excitements, and if relevant, personal connections to the topic. discuss project feasibility (i.e. pros and cons, potential barriers, etc). NOTE: students are not to work with pre-existing personal collections unless cleared with me.</li>

          <li>submit initial concept proposals by Friday at 2pm to Slack and student folders.</li>
