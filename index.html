assignments:
- Begin brainstorming directions for building a collection that will serve as the basis for your catalogue/final project direction. Start by developing smaller collections (ranging in focus & specificity) as an opportunity to see the possibilities of how each could unfold. Be prepared to discuss your process and findings for the next class.
- Begin experimenting with platforms for collecting and organizing content. Is there a specific process or platform that feels in-line with your content and workflow needs? (This is different for everyone!)
